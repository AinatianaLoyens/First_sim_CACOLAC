#Description
The codes in this repository are simulations of semi-discrete population models (prey-predator models).
The models are ODE systems that have a discrete part.
The aim is to plot prey and predators population according to their functions in the models.
I will vary the parameters.
I will visualize the equilibria by also plotting the theorical equilibria.
